**Rules Editor** helps you to create rules that convert your articles to [Facebok Instant Articles](https://instantarticles.fb.com/).

For using this tool you'll need:

*   A website containing articles.
*   A Facebook Page enabled to use Instant Articles and connected to your website.

The <abbr title="JavaScript Object Notation">JSON</abbr> file produced by this tool should be uploaded to a public URL and referenced by a meta tag inside the `<head>` tag of your articles:

`<meta property="ia:rules_url" content="path/to/your/rules-file.json"/>`
